Description: The Poverty Probability Index (PPI) is a poverty measurement tool 
    for organizations and businesses with a mission to serve the poor. The PPI 
    is statistically-sound, yet simple to use: the answers to 10 questions about 
    a household’s characteristics and asset ownership are scored to compute the 
    likelihood that the household is living below the poverty line – or above by 
    only a narrow margin. This package contains country-specific lookup data tables
    used as reference to determine the poverty likelihood of a household based
    on their score from the country-specific PPI questionnaire. The PPI is
    managed by Innovations for Poverty action <https://www.povertyindex.org>.
